## Overview
A game inspired by the Impossible Quiz (2007) by Splapp.
This quiz consists of 30 total questions, but choose Easy or Normal
and you'll only have access to half that amount. Think you
got what it takes to go through a gauntlet of stupid questions
and problems?

### Difficulty and Skips
There are three difficulty levels: *Easy*, *Normal*, and *Hard*.  <br />
__Easy:__ 5 Lives, <br />
__Normal:__ 3 Lives, <br />
__Hard:__ 1 Life <br />
  <br />
Play well enough and you'll gain skips as you play. To use a skip,
press "S". Note that some questions will NOT allow you to use skips.

### Behind the Scenes
Most questions will have answers, explanation, and commentary. Check those out if you have given the game a try.
