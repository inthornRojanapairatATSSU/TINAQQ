THIS IS NOT A QUIZ QUIZ: BEHIND THE SCENES AND OVERVIEW
 
A game inspired by the Impossible Quiz (2007), created
by the user Splapp.

This game consists of a total 30 questions, but the player
has access to half of that amount if they choose to select
Easy and Normal.

 Questions will contain answers, explanations, summary,
 and sometimes commentary.

If this is the player's first time in running this program,
DO NOT OPEN THE QUESTIONS' CLASSES! You can tell yourself
how stupid this game was after you completed it.

This is the second and completely revisioned build.
